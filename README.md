# Balls Collision -  MATLAB Simulation
### MATLAB Code for Balls collision
#### This is unlike other functions where we have to pass parameters, this program can be executed by just clicking on run button

### Explaination
#### In this file two balls of radius = 20 and color red and blue are taken, they start from fixed point with randomly choosen different velocity and direction, the point when they collide, simulation stops and shows the time taken for collision

#### What can be changed?

#####Radius of Balls can be changed, at line 25 by changing `size = ??`
#####Color can be changed, at line 26 and 27, ` color1 ='green' ` or 'black'
#####Width and Hight of window can be changed, at line 10 and 11
